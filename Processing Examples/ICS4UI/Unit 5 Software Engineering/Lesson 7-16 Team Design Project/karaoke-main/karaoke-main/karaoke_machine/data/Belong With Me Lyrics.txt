I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night/49

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans/153
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be/161
Laughing on a park bench, thinkin' to myself:/170
"Hey, isn't this easy?"/178
And you've got a smile that could/184
Light up this whole town/189
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down/193
You say you're fine, I know you better than that/201
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?/209

Has been here the whole time/243
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you/247
Been here all along/257

When you know you're 'bout to cry/356
I know your favourite songs/360
And you tell me 'bout your dreams/364
Think I know where you belong/368
Think I know it's with me/372
Can't you see that I'm the one/380
